# chevron.db

Db is a simple PDO wrapper that offers some basic security and a few
helper methods to make interacting with DBs a little easier. While write queries
are reasonably abstracted, you are still expected to write your own read
queries.

Peruse the tests or, if present, the examples directory to see usage.

See [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/chevron/db) for version/installation info. At the moment, I recommend using `"chevron/db":"~3.0"`.
