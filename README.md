# chevron.db

Chevron aims to be a 'simple set of useful tools'. This means that it
exists as a humble collection of code I've written and found quite useful.

Chevron.db is a simple PDO wrapper that offers some basic security and a few
helper methods to make interacting with DBs a little easier. While write queries
are reasonably abstracted, you are still expected to write your own read
queries.

# usage

If there isn't an examples dir, look through the tests.

# installation

Using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) `"require" : { "henderjon/chevron-db": "2.*" }`

# where is version 1.*?

Packagist (an important component to the composer ecosystem) prefers dashes as separators (I was
using dots). I had to update all the package names accordingly.

# license

See LICENSE.md for the [BSD-3-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license.
